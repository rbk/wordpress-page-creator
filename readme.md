# WordPress Page Creator

I made this plugin to assist with creating a list of pages easily. In a WordPress settings page called "Page Creator", you can enter a list of page titles to create multiple pages at once.
The textarea requires that each page title be on its own line. This plugin also comes with a page selector to create multiple subpages in this way.

1. Install plugin normally
2. Activate plugin
3. Go to "Settings" => "Page Creator"
4. Enter a list of pages in the textarea
5. Click submit.

If the page exists, it will not be added.
